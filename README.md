# Facial Reaction Detection

A comprehensive real-time system for detecting various emotional and physical states such as **drowsiness**, **stress**, and **fatigue** based on facial reactions. The system uses a combination of computer vision techniques (EAR, gaze tracking, facial landmarks) and machine learning models (e.g., CNN) with a PyQt-based GUI.

## Project Objective

This project aims to develop a real-time facial analysis system capable of recognizing:
- **Drowsiness** via Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), mouth opening (MAR), and blinking detection
- **Stress** using eye movement instability, pupil fluctuation, and facial Action Units (AUs) via OpenFace
- **Fatigue** using a deep learning model trained on labeled datasets

All components are integrated into a modular GUI for real-time visualization and logging.
